### Professional Experience

*iOS Software Engineer | Microsoft*

As a Software Engineer, I led the end-to-end design and development of a high-performance Accessibility Assistant application built in SwiftUI, ultimately impacting millions of global users. My architectural focus was on delivering highly scalable, production-ready solutions with guaranteed **100% compliance with WCAG standards and Apple HIG**. I partnered closely with cross-functional stakeholders (UX/UI, Product, Backend) to translate complex requirements into intuitive features, while simultaneously authoring comprehensive technical documentation and architecture guidelines to mentor developers and accelerate onboarding within the Agile development framework.

*iiOS Engineer | Limeade*

I served as the **iOS Guild Team Lead**, successfully mentoring mid- and junior-level developers and driving the crucial adoption of accessibility-first design principles and Apple best practices across the mobile organization. I was responsible for the design and maintenance of a modular SwiftUI/UIKit component library that ensured consistent UI/UX across both iPhone and iPad platforms. Furthermore, I owned the mobile deployment process, implementing and maintaining robust CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps to enable automated testing, continuous integration, and rapid, reliable delivery of features in collaboration with QA and product stakeholders.

*iOS Engineer | EE Solutions*

In this **Lead iOS Developer** capacity, I drove the entire development cycle for a live production iOS/iPad application built entirely in SwiftUI for a high-traffic enterprise environment. I was responsible for implementing core infrastructure components, including robust REST API integration, dynamic data handling, and offline caching strategies. Crucially, I championed code reliability by leading the adoption of unit testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD) across the development lifecycle, while actively mentoring team members on Swift best practices, modular architecture, and delivering features on aggressive timelines without compromising quality.

*iOS Engineer | FlaveApp*

As an **Lead iOS Developer**, I was responsible for maintaining a critical hybrid UIKit/SwiftUI application, with a strong emphasis on continuous optimization of the user experience in strict alignment with accessibility standards and Apple best practices. This role required high efficiency to address production issues and resolve bugs quickly, providing continuous enhancement to the app's core functionality and stability during a high-growth phase.

*Full Stack Developer | Plate Ratee*

In this **Full Stack Developer** role, I leveraged my frontend expertise to design responsive web interfaces using modern frameworks, including ReactJS, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6), resulting in a measurable increase in user engagement across web components. I ensured high code quality and development efficiency by maintaining consistent code reviews and collaborating closely with QA to execute robust End-to-End (E2E) testing using Cypress and WebDriver, which significantly enhanced system reliability and quality control for releases.

## Device health

## The Device Health Command Center: Proactive iOS Optimization

This application is designed as the definitive **Operating System for your Operating System**, transforming complex, low-level device data into understandable, actionable insights. It moves device maintenance from a reactive process (fixing a problem after it occurs) to a proactive strategy (optimizing resources before slowdowns happen), ensuring users consistently experience peak performance, longevity, and data security from their iOS/iPadOS hardware.

---

### Core Value Proposition

The primary value is **demystifying device performance**. For power users, it provides the granular data needed for deep optimization. For everyday users, it delivers **AI-driven, natural-language recommendations** to maximize battery life, reclaim significant storage, and ensure the hardware runs efficiently. It is built to extend the useful life of the device while maintaining a fluid and reliable user experience.

### Technical Components and Features

The application is architected around real-time data ingestion and an intelligent recommendation engine.

1.  **Real-Time Performance Dashboard:**
    * **System Metrics:** Live monitoring of CPU utilization, GPU load, and memory pressure.
    * **Network & Thermal Health:** Real-time latency checks, data usage breakdowns per app, and precise internal temperature logging.
    * **Hardware Longevity:** Detailed reporting on battery cycle counts, current maximum capacity degradation, and projected end-of-life based on usage patterns.

2.  **Smart Recommendation Engine:**
    * This proprietary engine utilizes on-device machine learning to analyze user habits (e.g., app usage frequency, charging cycles, typical time spent on Wi-Fi vs. cellular).
    * **Actionable Guidance:** Provides simple, targeted recommendations, such as: "Close 5 background apps to reduce overnight battery drain by 8\%," or "Delete unused cached data from App X to reclaim 2.5 GB of storage."

3.  **Comprehensive Storage Analyzer:**
    * A deep-scan feature that breaks down storage into semantic categories (e.g., "Large Media," "Obsolete Caches," "System Logs").
    * Includes a **Find & Flag** tool to identify and surface media files that haven't been opened in over six months, making storage management effortless.

4.  **Security and Privacy Audit:**
    * Checks for and flags outdated operating system versions and critical security patches.
    * Identifies apps with excessive or high-risk permissions (e.g., constant background location access, full photo library access) and provides one-tap links to revoke them.

The application leverages the latest **SwiftUI** for a highly responsive, modern, and design-centric user interface, while using frameworks like **HealthKit** (for relevant health context) and low-level **System APIs** to gather comprehensive and precise device telemetry.

## Utils

## Modular SwiftUI Utilities: Enterprise Foundation

This library is a **foundational collection of essential SwiftUI utilities** engineered specifically for high-velocity, enterprise-grade iOS application assembly. It provides development teams with a curated set of battle-tested extensions, reusable view modifiers, and complex atomic components, ensuring consistency and quality across large-scale projects.

---

### Core Value Proposition

The primary goal of these utilities is to drastically reduce boilerplate code and accelerate feature delivery. By providing pre-built, production-ready modules, engineers can shift their focus from repetitive implementation tasks (like custom button styling, robust state handling, or complex layout abstractions) to **solving unique business logic**. The result is accelerated development velocity without compromising the stability or maintainability required in an enterprise environment.

### Technical Components and Features

This framework is composed of three core modular elements:

1.  **Essential View Extensions:** Standardized extensions for fundamental SwiftUI types that enhance developer ergonomics. This includes simplified accessors for styling (e.g., semantic color palettes, typography) and common layout adjustments.
2.  **Reusable View Modifiers:** A library of custom, composable modifiers that encapsulate design tokens and cross-app behaviors. Examples include dynamic theming hooks, standardized accessibility wrappers, and performance-optimized view update strategies.
3.  **Atomic View Components:** Pre-designed, highly-tested components (like customized text fields, stateful buttons, modal presenters, and scalable navigation stacks) that can be instantly plugged into any feature. These components enforce strict adherence to design systems and **Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)**, ensuring a world-class user experience out-of-the-box.

The entire framework is designed for maximum **testability**, allowing teams to integrate unit and snapshot testing effortlessly, guaranteeing that all application features assembled with these utilities inherit robust quality standards.
