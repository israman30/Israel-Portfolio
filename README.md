###### *Technology*

- *Developing native applications requires leveraging the capabilities of both Google and Apple's integrated development environments (IDEs). In Xcode, I adeptly employ Swift's `async/await` syntax alongside the `Codable` protocol to handle asynchronous tasks and data parsing efficiently. On the Android platform, I utilize `OkHttpClient` for HTTP operations and integrate the `Picasso` library to streamline image loading processes. This combination ensures robust and responsive mobile applications across both ecosystems.*

- *In mobile application development, efficient rendering of lists is achieved through the use of `UICollectionView` in Xcode and `RecyclerView` in Android Studio. These components optimize performance by reusing cells or items during the rendering process. Implementing caching mechanisms for each cell/item minimizes repetitive network calls, as cached data is utilized when a cell/item is reused. This approach enhances application efficiency and provides a smoother user experience.*
